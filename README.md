Hi! ðŸ‘‹

You've opened the IDE Sandbox, an environment that you can access on "readme" and "code-along" lessons in Learn. It's a great place to experiment with code! ðŸŽ‰

*IMPORTANT*
Saving varies by the type of work you are doing:
-- Most of the work you do in the Sandbox is automatically saved on your behalf to the `learn-co-sandbox` repository in your GitHub account. Please DO NOT touch this repository in GitHub. Doing so will affect your Sandbox experience, and potentially cause your work to fall out of sync.
-- *Git repositories that you clone into the Sandbox are NOT automatically saved.* In this case, you are responsible for committing and pushing your work to GitHub. 

To learn more about the Sandbox, please visit http://help.learn.co/technical-support/learn-ide-in-browser/ide-in-browser-sandbox

##Cocktail DB CLI Application - Ariel Murphy


Welcome to my project. The purpose of this application is to be able to quickly pull up a list of ingredients of a drink from the Cocktail DB API. This API was listed as a free API, however for a more indepth application, other API's from this website may be used or purchased. This is just a standard and quick application to show you one of the many ways you can perform a CLI in Ruby for the Ruby final project assigned by Flatiron.

# CLI::CDB

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/CLI/CDB`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'CLI-CDB'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install CLI-CDB

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
